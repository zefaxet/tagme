Lightweight music metadata editing GUI. Making it for myself because I'm annoyed with my cheap skeleton audio files.

Basically when I am at work with my music running, I see what song is playing and the album art is missing and there is no album or artist name attached to that. I'm making this to solve the problem so that I can just run the app and click a button to have the file filled out automagically.
